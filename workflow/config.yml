admixMapping:

  other_predictors: 'sex'  # this should include the variable names provided in covariate_file if those variables are desired to be included in the admixture mapping.
  sig_threshold: '0.005' # Used for annotation purposes.  Windows with p-value below this will be annotated with overlapping genes
  annotation_buffer: '100000' #Add this amount to each side of the window when looking for overlapping genes.
gwas:
  mbc_pval: '0.0001' # pvalue threshold for missingness-by-case
  missingness: '0.05' # missingness threshold

singularity:

  image: '/home/pmonnaha/pmonnaha/singularity/AncestryInference.sif' # MODIFY: Path to singularity image file.  The one I used for everything is named AncestryInference.sif, which can be created from scratch using .def file in repo.
  code: 'scripts/' #Path to the scripts directory that was cloned with repo.  Should not need to change this value.
  module: 'module load singularity' #Command that the HPC requires for use of singularity.  Set to empty string if singularity is loaded by default.
LD_pruning:

sHWE:
  pop_nums: '1,2,3,4,5,6' # From these choices, the pipeline will try to find the optimal number of populations to use in latent factor analysis used in the structured HWE procedure.  The program will error out as values increase (e.g. 8 for ADMIRAL).
  threshold: '0.000001' # p-value threshold for filtering based on departure from sHWE
  bins: '30' #Used for identifying optimal value for population number.  Number of bins to divide p-value distribution into.  Sensitivity to this parameter has not been tested.
  downsample_rounds: '2000' # Number of downsampled (DS) datasets to create. See the README for discussion on why this is necessary
  downsample_number: '1000' # Number of individuals in each DS dataset
  maf: '0.05' # Markers with minor allele frequency below this will be removed
  test_threshold: '500000' # Number of markers to be tested.  Only markers that pass sHWE test will be used for structure & kinship estimation.  It can take a lot of rounds of downsampling to achieve high numbers here, so reduce this value if not passing checkpoints. 200k is sufficient.
IBD:

  filter_relateds: 'false' # This should be left as false.  No need to filter related individuals in BLINK or GENESIS.  However, this is enforced in admixture mapping regardless of value set here.
kinship_threshold: '0.125'  # Values below this are set to 0 (unrelated) in GENESIS
match_controls: 'false' #If set to true, data will be subset to matched controls via PLINK's clustering based control matching algorithm.
control_number: '4' #Ignored if match_controls is set to false.  Otherwise, this many controls will be retained for each case sample.
covariate_file: 'none' # Not tested; Tab-delimited file with header line specifying names of covariates.  First column MUST be labeled with 'taxa' and should contain sample IDs EXACTLY as they are specified in input plink files.
